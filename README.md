It features user authentication, allowing multiple users to have their own private data sources and chat histories.FeaturesUser Authentication: Secure login and registration system for multiple users.Personalized Data Sources: Each user can upload their own documents (.pdf, .docx, .txt, .csv) or provide a URL to create a personal knowledge base.Conversational AI: Interact with your data through a chat interface powered by LangChain and Google's Gemini models.Chat History: All conversations are saved and can be revisited later. Users can also delete past chats.Data Privacy: User data and chat histories are stored separately for each user.Easy to Use: Simple and intuitive web interface built with Streamlit.Getting StartedThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesPython 3.7+A Google AI API keyInstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/kalivemularajendra/rag_chatbot.git](https://github.com/kalivemularajendra/rag_chatbot.git)
